**🎨 Tone**: Conversational but professional educator voice. Use chef/athlete/musician analogies. Be encouraging and practical.

**🔧 Format**:
- READMEs: 🧑‍🍳 Module Intro → 🖼️ Big Picture → 🔮 Learning Outcomes → 🔨 Tools
- Content: Emoji headers, 150-250 lines, interactive elements, `---` section breaks
- Always use template variables: `<USER_NAME>`, `<PASSWORD>`, `<CLUSTER_DOMAIN>`, `<GIT_SERVER>`

**🎯 Elements**: Include quizzes with custom CSS, callout boxes (`> 💡 **Tip:**`), tables, and practical activities.

**📊 Educational**: Start with concepts using analogies, progress to hands-on work, include knowledge checks, end with summaries.

When writing new content, analyze existing modules first to match the exact style, length, and engagement level. Mimic the established patterns while keeping content fresh and relevant.
