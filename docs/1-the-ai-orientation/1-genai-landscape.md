# 🌐 GenAI Landscape & Foundation Models

## 📝 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) refers to models that can create new content — text, images, audio, video, or even code — by learning patterns from large datasets. These models don’t “think” like humans but generate outputs based on probability distributions learned during training.

## 🏗️ Foundation Models — The Backbone of GenAI

Foundation Models (FMs) are large models trained on vast amounts of general data that can be adapted to a wide range of tasks with minimal adjustments.

Examples include:

* **GPT Series (OpenAI)** — Text generation
* **Stable Diffusion** — Image generation
* **Whisper (OpenAI)** — Speech recognition
* **Gemini (Google)** — Multimodal understanding

## 📊 Open vs Closed Models

| Feature  | Open Models                             | Closed Models         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Access   | Free/Source-available                   | API-only/Commercial   |
| Control  | Full control over weights & fine-tuning | Limited control       |
| Examples | LLaMA 3, Mistral, Stable Diffusion      | GPT-4, Claude, Gemini |

## 🔄 Pretraining, Fine-tuning & Prompting

| Stage       | What Happens                                     | Example                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Pretraining | Model learns general patterns from huge datasets | Training GPT-3 on internet-scale data |
| Fine-tuning | Model adapts to specific tasks or domains        | Training a chatbot for legal advice   |
| Prompting   | Guiding a pretrained model to perform a task     | Asking ChatGPT for code review        |

## 🧩 Activities for Peer Learning

### 🗺️ Activity 1 — **Model Map**

* Form small groups
* Each group picks a model type: LLM, Diffusion Model, Speech Model, Multimodal Model
* Research (or use provided materials) to fill out:

  * Model Name
  * Open or Closed
  * Known Use Case
  * Example Product using it
* Share with the class using sticky notes / whiteboard / Miro

---

### 🗣️ Activity 2 — **Open vs Closed Debate**

* Split into two teams
* Scenario: "You need to build a secure customer support chatbot for a bank."
* One team argues for Open Models, the other for Closed Models
* Discuss trade-offs on:

  * Privacy
  * Cost
  * Control
  * Performance
* End with a group reflection
