# üåê Powering CanopyUI with RAG Capabilities

Now that you have a production-ready document intelligence RAG pipeline processing academic papers automatically, it's time to bring this powerful capability directly to your students through an intuitive web interface.

**CanopyUI** transforms your automated RAG system into an interactive educational platform where students ask intelligent questions, and receive comprehensive answers backed by document intelligence.

Your production pipeline handles the heavy lifting in the background, while CanopyUI provides the user-friendly frontend that makes document intelligence accessible to everyone.
