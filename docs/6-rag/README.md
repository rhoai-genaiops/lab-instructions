# Module 6 - RAG: Memory for AI

> Teaching an AI to remember is like giving it a library card. Without access to external knowledge, even the smartest model is limited to what it learned during training. With RAG, your AI can look up, learn from, and reason about any document you provide 📚

# 🧑‍🍳 Module Intro

This module bridges the gap between basic AI interactions and intelligent systems that can learn and recall from your specific documents and knowledge bases. You'll discover how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) transforms static AI models into dynamic assistants that can reference course materials, institutional documents, and student submissions.

At Redwood Digital University, we're building Canopy to help educators and students interact with vast amounts of academic content. RAG is the technology that makes this possible - turning your documents into searchable, queryable knowledge that enhances every AI interaction.
