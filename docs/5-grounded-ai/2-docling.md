# 🐣 Document Intelligence with Docling

Your RAG system works great with simple text, but what happens when students upload research papers with complex tables, mathematical formulas, and multi-column layouts? Traditional text extraction loses the meaning trapped in structured academic content.

**Docling** enhances your RAG system with an intelligent document processor that understands:

* 📊 **Complex tables** with research data and experimental results
* 🧮 **Mathematical formulas** and scientific notation
* 📈 **Charts and figures** that visualize key concepts
* 📝 **Multi-column layouts** typical of academic papers
* 🏛️ **Document structure** like sections and references

## Build Document Intelligence

Let's try it out to see how Docling works in practice!

Go to your workbench and go through the notebook `canopy/5-rag/3-docling.ipynb`.

## 🎯 Next Steps: Setting Up a Vector Database

Now that you get your hands into RAG and understand its value, it's time to make it production ready. And first, you'll need a place to store your document embeddings: that's where Vector Databases come in.

Let's dive into the world of embeddings and vector databases!
